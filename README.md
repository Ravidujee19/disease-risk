# Disease Risk Predictor ðŸ©º

## Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Disease Risk Prediction System** built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.  
It enables end-users to input their daily lifestyle and health-related attributes to predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases.

The project is divided into multiple phases following a **data science pipeline**:
1. **Dataset Collection & Preparation** â€“ Raw health and lifestyle dataset is stored in `data/raw/`.
2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** â€“ Cleaned and transformed data stored in `data/processed/`.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Insights and visualizations created in Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/eda_only.ipynb`).
4. **Modeling** â€“ Multiple ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) trained and evaluated.
5. **Streamlit Deployment** â€“ Interactive web UI for predictions (`app/streamlit_app.py`).

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ravidujee19/disease-risk
   cd disease-risk-main
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App
Run the Streamlit app locally:
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## Features
- User-friendly **Streamlit UI** for single or batch predictions.
- Handles **categorical and numerical preprocessing** with saved pipeline (`preprocessing.joblib`).
- **Multiple ML models** trained, best one saved as `best_model.pkl`.
- Supports **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** via Jupyter notebooks.
- Modular codebase following **MLOps best practices** (data â†’ preprocess â†’ model â†’ deploy).

---

## Future Improvements
- Integration with cloud storage for model artifacts.
- Docker-based deployment for reproducibility.
- Enhanced model explainability with SHAP or LIME.
- Continuous retraining pipeline for new data.
